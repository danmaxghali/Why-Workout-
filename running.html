        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p class="text">Running is popular activity, and for good reason. Even the most minimal 5-10 
            minutes a day at less than 6mph is associated with reducing risk of death, especially when caused by
            cardiovascular disease. A study by Lee <em>et al.</em>(2014) found that if all
            the non-runners in their study became runners, cardiovascular disease deaths would drop by 25%!

        <p class="text">
            To reduce death by such a percentage, it would involve consistent leisure running over a long period of
            time. This study ephasises that if you can just start by walking you will already begin to have
            an effect and create good habits.
