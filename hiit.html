        <h3>HIIT</h3>
        <p class="text">High intensity interval training or HIIT is a structure of exercising (it works best
            for cardiovascular exercising), that involves short bursts of any exercise activty performed at
            near maximal effort with periods of rest or less intense exercise in between.
            <br>
            <br>
            One example activity that can be used is burpees as seen in the image. This is a challenging
            full body activity. Alternatively any exercise that gets you out of breath can be good, so 
            do what you prefer. 
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Exercising at such a high intensity can be mentally challenging, but the small breaks in between
            make this more feasable. If you can manage, it is highly rewarding for the body given the 
            adaptations in heart function and aerobic capacity.
