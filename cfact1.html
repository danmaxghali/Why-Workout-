        <h3>Affect of cardiovascular exercise on the heart</h3>
        <p class="text">Moderate and intense cardiovascular exercise can cause your heart and
             circulatory system to adapt, which can allow you to live longer
            <br>
            <br>
            It does this by:
        </p>
        <ul class="text">
                <li>Muscular growth of the heart - This makes it more efficient by doing the same amount
                    of work for less effort, and subsequently lowers your resting heart rate.
                </li>
                <li>Muscular growth of blood vessels - This allows them to carry more blood at a higher
                    pressure, which makes exercise easier
                </li>
        </ul>
